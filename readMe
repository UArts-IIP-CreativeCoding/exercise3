Use what you’ve learned about motion and images to load images into a kinetic collage, that changes upon input. Use only your own images or images that you have permission to use. Flickr is a good source if you don’t want to use your own photos: http://www.flickr.com/commons/.  Use an array to store your images by name (string). Use a for loop to cycle through that array to then load the images.
